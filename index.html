                <h2>Because the Land is Yours, and Adventure is Necessary.</h2>
                   <p>After the lockdown for Covid-19, we have been looking for places to reset, be away from 
                     crowded areas, and find some peace. We have so many public lands all over the US, from National
                     Forests and National Parks, to State Forests and Parks. ETU will help you prepare for your next
                     outdoor getaway, we know camping can be overwhelming if never done, but we will ensure to give you all 
                     you need to go camping, like safety planning routes, necessary gears based on the type of camping, 
                     food and water prep, public lands guidelines, etc. We got your back! Take advantage of your land, and 
                     reconnect with nature with the best weekend getaway yet!

                    <h3>Overlanding</h3>
                    <img src="https://trail4runner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/lattet4r_overland_4runner.jpg" alt="Overlanding">                   
                     <p>Overlanding can also be called motorized camping, the difference is that overlanders explore
                    areas that are new to them. I.e., If you are visiting Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, 
                    planning out your new routes, and your campsites (In most National Forests you can camp anywhere
                    as long as you follow the marked guidelines to do so). You will discover the most epic views 
                    you have ever seen!

                    <p>Not beautiful place can be driven to, sometimes we have to walk to find those hidden gems. Backpacking 
                   will get you to those gems, and stay the night to enjoy it even longer.

                    <p>What if that spot I want to see is surrounded by water? Well, canoe/kayak camping is your option! Many of those small 
                    islands you see in a river or lake can be rowed to, and camping is allowed. We will help you Find them!
